# Automated Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a Python script, autolysis.py, which performs automated analysis on a given dataset. The analysis includes generating summary statistics, detecting outliers, performing correlation analysis, clustering, and visualizing the results. Additionally, the script will provide an insightful narrative summarizing the findings of the analysis.

## How to Run the Script

To run the Python script, use the following command:

bash
uv run autolysis.py <dataset.csv>


Replace <dataset.csv> with the actual dataset filename (e.g., goodreads.csv, happiness.csv, media.csv).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following environment variable set up before running the script:

bash
export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your-ai-proxy-token"


This token is required for using the LLM during analysis.

### Output Files

The script will generate the following output files in the current directory:

- README.md: A markdown file containing the results of the automated analysis.
- chart1.png, chart2.png, chart3.png: Data visualizations in PNG format supporting the analysis.

## Analysis and Findings

### Data Summary

The dataset consists of the following columns and types:

- *Column Name 1*: Description (e.g., numeric, categorical)
- *Column Name 2*: Description (e.g., numeric, categorical)
- ...
  
Summary statistics, missing values, and sample data values were analyzed to identify patterns and insights.

### Outlier Detection

The analysis detected the following outliers:

- *Outlier 1*: Explanation
- *Outlier 2*: Explanation

These outliers may indicate errors, fraud, or high-impact opportunities.

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis revealed the following key relationships:

- *Variable 1* and *Variable 2* have a strong positive correlation (r = 0.85).
- *Variable 3* and *Variable 4* show no significant correlation.

### Clustering and Grouping

Using unsupervised learning, we identified the following groups:

- *Group 1*: Characteristics and insights
- *Group 2*: Characteristics and insights

These clusters can inform decisions on marketing, resource allocation, etc.

### Visualizations

1. *Chart 1*: [Insert description of chart 1 here]
   ![Chart 1](chart1.png)

2. *Chart 2*: [Insert description of chart 2 here]
   ![Chart 2](chart2.png)

3. *Chart 3*: [Insert description of chart 3 here]
   ![Chart 3](chart3.png)

### Insights and Implications

The key insights from this analysis include:

- *Insight 1*: Explanation and implication
- *Insight 2*: Explanation and implication

### Recommendations

Based on the findings, we recommend:

- *Recommendation 1*: Actionable step to address the insight
- *Recommendation 2*: Actionable step to address the insight

## Conclusion

The automated analysis and visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, uncovering significant patterns and offering actionable recommendations. The results can help inform decisions in various domains such as marketing, resource allocation, and strategy development.
